UsbongKit is a framework that contains the main components for Usbong.

# To-do

- [x] Add documentation
- [ ] CocoaPods support

# Running the Example App

- Make sure you have [carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) installed
- Run `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS` in the project

  For example, UsbongKit is located in ~/Developer/Usbong/UsbongKit. Therefore, I navigate to the folder in the terminal using "cd" command, and then, run "carthage update" or "carthage update --platform iOS" (specifying the platform will make the update finish faster, since it will only build the frameworks for iOS). Once all dependencies have been downloaded and built, the UsbongKit example app should now be able to be built and run in a simulator or an iOS device.

- Build and run the `UsbongKit-example` target

# Installation

You can integrate `UsbongKit` in your project in 3 different ways:

## 1. [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) (Recommended)

3. Follow [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) instructions to add frameworks in your project

## 2. Project

1. Drag-and-drop `UsbongKit.xcodeproj` as sub-project
2. Run `carthage update --platform iOS` in UsbongKit folder to fetch dependencies
3. Link `UsbongKit.framework` in your project

## 3. Embed Framework

1. Run `carthage update --platform iOS` in UsbongKit folder to fetch dependencies
2. Build `UsbongKit` framework
3. Embed `UsbongKit.framework` in your project

# View utree

To view a utree file, import the framework, `import UsbongKit`, then add this code in your app:

```swift

// parentViewController is the controller which will present the Usbong tree viewer
// treeURL is the URL for the compressed .utree
Usbong.presentViewer(onViewController: parentViewController, withUtreeURL: treeURL)

```
